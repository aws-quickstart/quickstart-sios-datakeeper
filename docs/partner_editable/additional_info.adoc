== Test the deployment

The easiest way to determine whether SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition has been correctly deployed and configured is to launch Failover Cluster Manager on one of the replication nodes, and switch over resources. Follow these steps:

1. Connect to the Remote Desktop Gateway instance.
2. From that node, RDP into the replication node.
3. When you’ve connected to a replication node, launch Failover Cluster Manager.
4. In the left pane, choose Roles, and verify that the MSSQLSERVER role is online.
5. In the Roles pane, open the context (right-click) menu for MSSQLSERVER, choose Move, Select Node, and then choose the other replication node as the destination node. The role should come online within two minutes.
6. Move the role back to the primary replication node. If the role comes online without any issues on either node, the deployment was successful and can be used as desired.

For further configuration details, see the http://docs.us.sios.com/[SIOS technical documentation].

== Best practices for using DataKeeper on AWS

=== AWS services

SIOS recommends following AWS best practices for creating and using IAM roles and policies, IAM user credentials and roles, and access key rotation.

* IAM roles: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_forservice.html
* IAM policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html
* IAM users: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_sign-in.html
* Access keys: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-rotate-access-keys-for-iam-users/

=== SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition

SIOS also has some recommendations for customers seeking optimal performance. These recommendations include considerations specific to both the Windows operating system and the AWS Cloud configurations.

The primary component of SIOS DataKeeper is an upper filter volume driver. This driver tracks and processes every request sent to a source volume, and therefore incurs some overhead for all volume operations. When properly configured in a cloud environment, this overhead should be no more than 10-20 percent.

* Instance size - Replication performance relies on several factors. While CPU usage is minimal, RAM utilization depends entirely on network performance, peak active workload, volume read/write latency, and the number of concurrent mirrors under load. With these considerations in mind, SIOS recommends using instance sizes that have at least medium network performance, enabling Amazon EBS optimization by default, and providing at least one instance for storage volume. The r3.xlarge instance size is the smallest recommended instance size if performance is a concern. If performance is not an issue, SIOS DataKeeper can be installed on any instance size that is currently available.
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSOptimized.html[Amazon EBS optimization] - This feature is required for best performance. It is turned on by default in the Quick Start deployment.
* Instance storage - Several features of SIOS DataKeeper rely on very low latency volume access. Bitmap storage must be configured to reside on an instance storage volume. This is automatically configured during Quick Start deployment, but any nodes added to the cluster afterward will need http://docs.us.sios.com/dkce/8.6.4/en/topic/relocation-of-intent-log[manual configuration].
* Volume properties - While a simple volume is all that is required for proper mirror operation, more advanced techniques can be used to minimize read/write latency. SIOS recommends creating identical https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Storage-at-Microsoft/Using-the-Storage-Pools-page-in-Server-Manager-to-create-storage/ba-p/424656[Storage Pools] to support mirror volumes on both source and target systems. This Quick Start does not configure Storage Pools during deployment. Storage Spaces Direct is not compatible with SIOS DataKeeper, and should not be used.
* Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - SIOS DataKeeper does not add significantly to a typical cluster single-server outage failover RTO. Assuming appropriate instance sizes are utilized, resource contention is not an issue, SIOS DataKeeper is properly configured and in the mirroring state, and assuming trivial application recovery time, an RTO of <1 minute is possible. Realistically, an RTO of 2 –5 minutes should be expected unless the application being protected (Microsoft SQL Server, SAP, etc.) has an unusually large recovery time. Assuming the same conditions, RPO should be only a few milliseconds larger than the current network write latency between the source and target nodes. RPO can be measured with the http://docs.us.sios.com/dkce/8.6.4/en/topic/performance-monitor-counters#queuecurrentage[QueueCurrentAge perfmon counter]. In many cases, the RPO will be measured in milliseconds, but factors like network congestion, abnormally high disk write activity, or slow write performance on the target server can impact RPO greatly. SIOS DataKeeper does not conflict with Amazon EBS snapshots, and it can be used in conjunction with them on the source system. However, restoring a source volume from snapshot is not trivial, and will require a full resync of all data protected by the applicable mirror before the above RPO guidelines are applicable again. To optimize RTO and RPO, follow the http://docs.us.sios.com/dkce/8.6.5/en/topic/high-speed-storage-best-practices[best practices guide] for SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition.
