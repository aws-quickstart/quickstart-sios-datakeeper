image::../images/sios-datakeeper-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Remote Desktop Gateway instance in an Auto Scaling group for remote administration.*
* In the private subnets:
** Two Active Directory domain controllers.
** Two SQL Server cluster nodes featuring SIOS DataKeeper replication software.
** AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.
** An AWS Systems Manager to automate the deployment.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#
