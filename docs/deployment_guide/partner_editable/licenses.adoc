This Partner Solution uses Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) from the http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace^]. It
supports two licensing options:

* https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-hjmfysqc6xhem?qid=1627657774268&sr=0-1&ref_=srh_res_product_title[Pay as you go (PAYG)^] — Use this consumption-based option to pay an hourly fee
determined by usage. Current prices are listed on the AWS Marketplace page and billed
to your AWS account. This option doesn't require a license for SIOS DataKeeper.

* https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-n6qfra7iykmri[Bring your own license (BYOL)^] — Use this option if you have a current license for SIOS
DataKeeper Cluster Edition (which requires a run-time license for each server). You
can deploy the Partner Solution without first signing up for a license, but you must have a
license to start and run SIOS DataKeeper Cluster Edition. You can contact SIOS to
request a http://us.sios.com/contact-us/[run-time license^] or a http://us.sios.com/SAN-SANless-clusters/free-trial-evaluation-san-sanless-clusters[14-day free trial license^].

There is no cost to use this Partner Solution, but you will be billed for any AWS services or resources that this Partner Solution deploys. For more information, refer to the https://fwd.aws/rA69w?[AWS Partner Solution General Information Guide^].
