Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

.Quick Start architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/sios-datakeeper-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans three Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Remote Desktop Gateway instances in an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Auto Scaling group for remote administration.*
* In the private subnets:
** AWS Directory Service (Standard or Enterprise) to provision AD DS and to manage tasks such as monitoring domain controllers, and configuring backups and snapshots. You can also choose to add AD DS domain controllers as EC2 instances to the architecture and manage these yourself, as shown in <<architecture3>> and <<architecture4>>.
** Two Microsoft SQL Server cluster nodes featuring SIOS DataKeeper replication software.
** Amazon FSx for Windows File Server to provide quorum witness functionality to the Windows Server Failover Cluster Instance.
** AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.
** An AWS Systems Manager runbook to automate the deployment.
