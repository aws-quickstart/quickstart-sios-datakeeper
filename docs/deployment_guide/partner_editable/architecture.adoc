.Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/sios-datakeeper-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture, 80%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two (optionally three) Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) instances in an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Auto Scaling group for remote administration.*
* In the private subnets, a Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) cluster containing two (optionally three) Microsoft SQL Server nodes with SIOS DataKeeper replication software. Each node resides in a separate Availability Zone and contains an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume for replicated data storage. For information on supported operating system versions, refer to the http://docs.us.sios.com/WindowsSPS/current/SPS4W/dkce-support-matrix.html[DataKeeper Cluster Edition (DKCE) support matrix^].
* An https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/windows/[Amazon FSx for Windows File Server^] file system provides quorum witness functionality to the WSFC cluster.*
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/latest/admin-guide/what_is.html[AWS Directory Service^] for Microsoft Active Directory (Standard Edition or Enterprise Edition) to provision Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and to manage tasks such as monitoring domain controllers and configuring backups and snapshots. You can add AD DS domain controllers as EC2 instances to the architecture and manage these yourself.
* AWS Secrets Manager to store credentials.
* An AWS Systems Manager automation document to automate the deployment.
