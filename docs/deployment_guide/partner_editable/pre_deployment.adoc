=== Determine your EC2 instance size

Replication performance relies on several factors. While CPU usage is minimal, RAM utilization depends on network performance, peak active workload, volume read-write latency, and the number of concurrent mirrors under load. With these considerations in mind, SIOS recommends using EC2 instance sizes that have at least medium network performance. These instances enable Amazon EBS optimization by default and provide at least one instance for storage volume.

So if you're concerned about performance, SIOS recommends that you choose r3.xlarge instances or larger for the parameters `WSFCNode1InstanceType`, `WSFCNode2InstanceType`, and (if used) `WSFCNode3InstanceType` when you deploy this Partner Solution.
